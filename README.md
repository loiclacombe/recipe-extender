recipe-extender
===============

A website to store and extend cooking recipes.
Most cooking recipes websites only allow very few things:
* searching and viewing recipes
* adding recipes
* commenting and evaluating
Haven't you already thought "that recipe would be better with less/more sugar"? Then you tested it, of course. What about
keeping your own variation online and sharing it. You could keep a list of your favorite recipes, or variations
of recipes and not have to search this infamous piece of paper, find the baseline recipe on a website then alter it with
 your preferences (that you may forget).
This free website should do the trick
